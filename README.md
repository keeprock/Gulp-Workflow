# Keeprock Gulp workflow

Keeprock Gulp workflow is my personal building system for every front-end project right now.

It contains:

- Browsersync
- Autoprefixer
- HTML watch injection
- Image minimizer
- Notifier for info popups
- Sass support
- Sourcemaps support
- PostCSS support

That I like we most about this build, is that it allows me to easily work on multiple devices. With a help of BrowserSync we can see any changes instantly on every device.

# How to Install

Just copy all the files and use it a backbone for your project.
